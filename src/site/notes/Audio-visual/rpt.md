You have likely experienced the feeling that something has already happened, or that a situation is repeating itself. This phenomenon  is known as Déjà vu, and it is the inspiration for my project,  
titled "repete" or "rpt."  

My goal was to capture this phenomenon and ideally evoke  it in the viewer. This inspiration led to the design of an installation  and a unique book.  

It is an interactive installation where abstract patterns are formed. Each pattern is created from the same elements: a circle, a square, and a triangle. I chose these shapes because we see them practically every day. The patterns can be generated or changed in response to the viewer's interaction, and it is impossible for any of them to repeat exactly. However, some may be very similar, and this is where the association with the phenomenon of déjà vu lies.  

I designed the installation as a projection in a larger open space.  The Plato Gallery in Ostrava was my inspiration for the location.  It would most likely involve a large projection on the ground, over which visitors could walk and view from various angles.
