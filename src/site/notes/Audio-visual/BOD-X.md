Bod - xÂ originated as a graduation project. It all started with the idea that just as we influence the environment around us, the environment also influences us.Based on this idea, this project began to take shape.

It is a light/projection installation for which I used tulle canvases and plexiglass to achieve layered projection images.

The animation takes place in the premises of my now former high school. The building of the Secondary School of Arts and Crafts has a long and not always cheerful history. The atmosphere of the building changed along with the change of people. From an unpleasant darkened Justice Palace, which was part of a prison, it became an art school, which is a safe place for many of its students. The silhouettes in the animation represent both positive and negative individuals who have passed through the building. The distortion of space represents the change in the school's environment, which, however, has always remained fundamentally the same at its core.

The entire installation is meant to have a subjective impact on the viewer. The experience that the viewer takes away from it depends solely on how they perceive this whole and how it affects them.
