The discovery, creation, dissemination, and everything associated with it is wonderful. We should create and discover, but we should also look around us. Don't we sometimes demand too much from our surroundings, the environment, and indeed the entire Earth? I have  a simple answer to this question: Yes, we do.  

Since I have a strong relationship with music, I would somewhat compare it to the idea that every song must be balanced because  if it's not, it often turns into chaos. I would say that the entire project somewhat stands on this idea.  

You may notice that it involves an object based on organic matter resembling a liquid or a cell. This object then reacts to playing on electronic drums, creating a generative animation.  
In this work, the object represents some living part that we are all surrounded by. The drums represent our desire to constantly create, discover, and it could be said that it illustrates our desire to constantly play with something. It's also, for me, a very decisive instrument that is great for presenting something not entirely positive.  

The meaning lies in the fact that if everything is in moderationÂ and  a person is able to exist in harmony with nature, then everything can be beautiful and peaceful. As we can notice in the video, when I play calmly and without aggression, the object is somewhat tranquil and graceful. The second part is when it becomes too much and when  a person stops respecting the environment around them, upon which the environment suffers and begins to be destroyed. This is illustrated by faster and could be said more aggressive playing, during which the object loses its grace and is no longer pleasant to look at. However, when the playing calms down again, the object is able to return to its graceful form and is once again pleasant to look at. By this, I mean that if we gave the planet a bit of rest and let it regenerate, we would still have hope.
