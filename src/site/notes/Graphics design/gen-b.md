Gen-b is a pop-up accordion book that strives to connect the harsh features of brutalism with generative art. I decided to create the individual prints, which we can see on the pop-ups of the buildings, using geometric nodes. The result is generative prints that change or animate according to the change in values in the network of nodes or in real-time.  

My initial intention was to process this project only on the theme of generative art, but after wider discussion, I concluded that many people do not perceive generative art as real art. However, I did not want to back down from this idea, so I reached a compromise, where I try to present generative art as prints of brutalist architecture buildings.  

I chose brutalism because it is a relatively controversial architectural style that evokes many questions. It mainly involves very massive buildings with various geometric elements in concrete execution.  

Using brutalist architecture, I present pop-up buildings that carry a generative print composed of geometric shapes.
