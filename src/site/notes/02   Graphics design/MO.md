This is a logo that I created for myself. Along with the logo, I made  a 3D object. Given my strong relationship with music, the model is inspired by vinyl records and an equalizer. Another feature of the entire logo/object is that it is audio-reactive. Using TouchDesigner,  

I converted the mesh of the object into individual parts and then connected them to an audio-reactive spectrum.  Since I'm fascinated by 3D printing, I had the model printed on  a 3D 
printer by a friend.
