This is about a generative object that represents the concept of life  
in a cage. The inspiration for this work was the view of a housing estate with apartment blocks. I began to ponder the idea that few  of us are fortunate enough to have a house with a large garden  and be at least somewhat surrounded by nature. From this thought,  I made an object in which cubes are generated in various ways, representing these apartment blocks.  

As you look at the object, you might start to see reflections of a street, a square, or various other places associated with city life.
