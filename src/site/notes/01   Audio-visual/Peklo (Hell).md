This is an installation of hell, accompanied by video mapping in the premises of an old sugar factory. The entire installation was under my direction (lights, sound, video mapping), and my main goal was to create an intense atmosphere that impacted the viewer as soon as they took their first step into the mist.

I have been involved in the project for three years now, and the videos and photos are from various years.
