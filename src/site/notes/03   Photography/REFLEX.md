I focused on working with mirrors and laser beams, but also paid attention to how reflection, or 
the act of reflecting, works in real life  and how it can influence a person.  

Often, we don't even notice it, but we all have a tendency to reflect certain feelings and behaviors from ourselves. For example, when someone is kind to you, you tend to be kinder to others, and the  same goes for negative situations.  

Using a mask made of mirror shards along with laser beams, I tried  to highlight that we often don't notice, but we all have a tendency  to react to or reflect the emotions of others.
